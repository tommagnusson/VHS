Count the number of amoebas that can dance on the head of a pin.
1) The user inputs are:
       The radius of the pinhead 
       The space occupied by an amoeba
       The allowed overlap between amoebas subject to the restriction
       that no space can simultaneously be occupied by more than two
2) The program computes:
       The area of the pinhead based on its radius
       The amount of nonoverlapping space required by an amoeba
       The number of amoebas based on the preceding two values
3) The program ends by printing the number of amoebas.
